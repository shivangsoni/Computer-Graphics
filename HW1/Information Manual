Que1.How to execute the program?
Sol1.There is a input file named "input.txt" from which the program takes all information required to draw a polygon.

There is a output file named "output.txt" where all the modified coordinate information is to be stored.

For Compiling the code I use: g++  Final.cpp -lX11 -lGL -lGLU -lglut -g -Wall -O2 -o Final
Then running the compiled file through command prompt by: ./Final

Que2.How the program works?
Sol2.This is a console based interactive application.

Example:
The input file contain data for 2 polynomials like
2
4
5.0 5.0 
10.0 10.0
15.0 5.0
10.0 0.0
3
40.0 40.0
40.0 80.0
60.0 60.0

Then on Compilation and Execution we can able to see the polygons on the screen based on what data we provide.
 Please find the Screen Shots enclosed.
The program ask for the choices i.e what operation to perform.
Id of the polygon
Based on that operation will be performed.
